<div class="frame">
	<p>Use this form if you want to change the password you use for logging this account into ${gameName} and our website. If you do not wish to set a new password at this time, click the 
		logout link at the top right of this page.</p>
	<p>Please be absolutely sure that you only ever enter or change your password at <strong>${formattedHostName}</strong></p>
	<p>Please note that passwords must be between <strong>5 and 20</strong> characters in length. We recommend that you use a mixture of numbers and letters in your password to make it 
		harder for someone to guess.</p>
